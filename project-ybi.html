										<h2>About the Project</h2>
									</header>

									<p>A collaborative project with Youth Business International (YBI), leading the design, development, and launch of the YBI Community platform. This Salesforce Lightning Community-based solution served as the digital epicentre for YBI's global network, facilitating multi-lingual collaboration in English and Spanish among 45+ member countries supporting young entrepreneurs.</p>

									<div class="row">
										<div class="col-6 col-12-small">
											<h3>Situation</h3>
											<p>Youth Business International aimed to enhance collaboration and knowledge sharing among its members, who often faced challenges due to siloed information and limited interaction. The existing structure relied heavily on YBI staff for introductions, and in-person events were infrequent and costly.</p>
											<p>The task was to launch a Salesforce Lightning Community-based platform that would facilitate member-to-member connections, enabling autonomous collaboration and reducing barriers to sharing resources and best practices.</p>
										</div>
										<div class="col-6 col-12-small">
											<h3>Task</h3>
											<p>I was tasked with overseeing the design, delivery and ongoing management of YBI Community platform, for enduring collaboration, member engagement, and resource sharing.</p>
											<p>The primary objective was to successfully launch and manage a Salesforce Lightning Community-based platform, available in English and Spanish, that would serve as the digital hub for the YBI network.</p>
										</div>
									</div>

									<h3>Approach</h3>
									<p>As Digital Community Manager, I created comprehensive project briefs and conducted extensive user research. I developed user journey maps, prototypes, and community strategies based on insights gathered.</p>
									<p>I prioritised requirements, created roadmaps, and collaborated closely with the development team to manage the product. Additionally, I developed a detailed online community strategy, identified key metrics for growth, and produced a promotional video for the launch.</p>

									<h2>Results</h2>
									<p><span class="image left"><img src="images/ybi-results.jpg" alt="Photo of the YBI community launch video" /></span>The YBI Community platform launched successfully in June 2018, delivered within budget and timeframe. It created a central digital hub for YBI's global network, enhancing collaboration across 45+ countries.</p>
									<p>With over 50% sign-ups in two weeks and community champions appointed in 6 continents, the platform achieved team buy-in and established a central knowledge and events hub. This bilingual initiative significantly improved YBI's ability to support young entrepreneurs globally.</p>
